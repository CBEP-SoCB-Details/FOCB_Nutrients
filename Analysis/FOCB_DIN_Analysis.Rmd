# Introduction
This notebook Looks at DIN and TN numbers from Friends of Casco Bay samples.

FOCB reports the TN samples and DIN samples were sent to different laboratories,
and so direct comparison relies on consistent calibration, etc. across two labs.
Accordingly, here we restrict our analysis to looking at the two data sources as
complementary views of nitrogen in Casco Bay.

FOCB also reports that some DIN samples over the years had unusually high
ammonium values, and that those samples were noted by the laboratory conducting
the analyses, but not flagged as errors.  We create alternate data with select
samples removed from Ammonia and DIN values, but mostly focus on using robust
and resistant methods to minimize impact of those possibly erroneous samples.

A useful discussion of available robust and resistant methods in R is available 
on a [CRAN "Task View" for robust statistics]( https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Robust.html).

*  The `rlm()` and `lqs()` functions from MASS are fairly general, using
   m-estimators and minimization of only a subset of residuals, respectively.  
*  The `mblm()` function from `mblm` package offers simple linear regression
   models, but limited flexibility.  it does not handle categorical variables
   thoroughly.  
*  The WRS2 package addresses relatively simple ANOVA and ACOVA structures with
   several alternate modeling approaches.  
*  The `walrus` package is built on WRS2, but offers simplified user interface 
   and fewer functions.  It handles robust ANOVA and T tests.

# Load Data
## Folder References
```{r folder_refs}
sibfldnm <- 'Derived_Data'
parent <- dirname(getwd())
sibling <- file.path(parent,sibfldnm)

dir.create(file.path(getwd(), 'figures'), showWarnings = FALSE)
```

## Load Data
The data we use her has had a number of suspiciously high NH4 values removed.
See "FOCB_Nutrients_Combined.Rmd" for details and explanation/
```{r load_data}
strict_data <- read_csv(file.path(sibling, 
                                 "focb_n_data_strict.csv"))%>%
  mutate(month = factor(month, levels = month.abb),
         yearf = factor(year)) %>%
  mutate(dt = as.Date(dt))
```

# Station Names
```{r folder_refs_2}
fn <- 'FOCB Monitoring Sites SHORT NAMES.xlsx'
names_df <- read_excel(file.path(sibling, fn))
```

# Data Review
## Data Prevalence
```{r crosstabs}
xtabs(~station + year, data = strict_data[! is.na(strict_data$din),])
```
DIN data has been collected fairly consistently from a handful of sites over 
many years, and from many sites only in 2019.

## Data Distributions
```{r din_hist}
ggplot(strict_data , aes(din)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

A log transform is "too stong" for DIN and leaves us skewed the other way.
```{r din_site_hist}
ggplot(strict_data , aes(din)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = station)) +
  theme(legend.position = 'none') +
  scale_x_log10()
```

So data is distributed somewhere between normal and lognormal in terms of
skewness. But that skew could be due to data distributions, inappropriate 
transforms, or differences in sampling frequency among stations or years.

We can partially correct by using a generalized log transform, although
selection of the addative constant is fairly arbitrary.

(but not this assessmsnt changes with some data subsets, below).
```{r din_log_hist}
ggplot(strict_data , aes(log1p(din))) +
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = station)) +
  theme(legend.position = 'none')
```

But the log plus one  transform looks pretty good for most stations.
```{r facet_din_densities, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5}
ggplot(strict_data , aes(log1p(din + 1))) +
  geom_density(aes(fill = station)) +
  facet_wrap(~ station) +
  theme_minimal() +         # restores gridlines
  theme(legend.position = 'none')
```
A number of sites show tendencies towards bimodal distributions of DIN. Later 
analyses suggest that may reflect seasonal patterns.

## Cross- Plot DIN by TN
```{r tn_din_plot_ammonium_strict, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 7}
ggplot(strict_data, aes(tn, din_N)) + 
  geom_point(aes(fill = month), size = 2, shape = 21, alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1) +
  #scale_fill_manual(values = cbep_colors()) +
  coord_equal() +
  theme_cbep(base_size = 12) +
    ylab('DIN (mg/ l as N)') +
    xlab('TN (mg/l)')
```
# Recent Conditions
Recent conditions include data from 2015 through 2019.

We remove the data for KVL84 from these analyses, because we have very 
limited local data from that site.

```{r create_recent_data}
recent_data <- strict_data %>%
  filter(year > 2014) %>%
  filter(station != 'KVL84')
```

## Add Shortened Site Names
The key step here is reordering by median nitrogen values. That ordering will
need to be harmonized with TN ordering to generate final graphics.
```{r add_site_names}
recent_data <- recent_data %>%
   mutate(station_name = names_df$Alt_Name[match(station,
                                                names_df$Station_ID)]) %>%
   mutate(station = factor(station),
          station_name = factor(station_name)) %>%
   mutate(station = fct_reorder(station, tn, na.rm = TRUE),
         station_name = fct_reorder(station_name, tn, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
   relocate(station_name, .after = station) %>%
   select(-tn_depth, -tn, -organic_N)
```

# Extract Recent Results
This is the simplest analysis, with no hierarchical modeling.  We drop the 
extreme TN values, ass we do for most analyses coming up.
```{r recent_results}
recent_results <- recent_data %>%
  group_by(station) %>%
  summarize(across(nox:nh4_N, c(mn = ~ mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE),
                                  sd = ~ sd(.x, na.rm = TRUE), 
                                  n = ~sum(! is.na(.x)),
                                  md = ~ median(.x, na.rm = TRUE),
                                  iqr = ~ IQR(.x, na.rm = TRUE),
                                  p90 = ~ quantile(.x, .9, na.rm = TRUE),
                                  gm = ~ exp(mean(log(.x), na.rm = TRUE))))) %>%
  mutate(station_name = names_df$Alt_Name[match(station,
                                                names_df$Station_ID)]) %>%
  mutate(station = fct_reorder(factor(station), din_md),
         station_name = fct_reorder(factor(station_name), din_md)) %>%
  relocate(station_name, .after = station)
```

## Sample Frequencies
```{r sample_frequencies}
recent_results %>%
  select(station, contains('_N_n') )
```

We note that several stations have fewer than ten DIN samples over that period of
time. Only one site (KVL84, Knightville Landing, in South Portland) has fewer 
than five DIN values.  It and was dropped, above, for lack of recent data.

TN values are somewhat more abundant, with only a single site with fewer than
ten TN samples.

With the relatively low sample sizes for most sites, complex models may 
perform poorly.  Interactions with time of year and year, in particular, will
lead to many empty cells in the implicit model design.

# Models
We want to look at recent conditions, taking into account as best we can 
possible covariates, including year and time of year.  Our goal is to extract
marginal means by station for the recent data, and evaluate trends for the
long-term data.

# Recent Data
## Linear Model
We begin by constructing conventional linear models on log transformed DIN data.
```{r full_lm}
full_din_lm <- lm(log(din_N) ~ station *  month + yearf, data = recent_data)
anova(full_din_lm)
```

Stepwise model selection confirms that the interaction term is of little value
(by AIC; not shown) .
```{r reduced_lm}
din_lm <- lm(log(din_N) ~ station +  month + yearf, data = recent_data)
anova(din_lm)
```
### Model Diagnostics
```{r reduced_lm_diagnostics}
oldpar <- par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(din_lm)
par(oldpar)
```
We have a few values that are fairly badly underestimated (large negative 
residuals), but this is not dreadful. Residuals are somewhat heavy tailed.

```{r look_at_outliers}
recent_data[c(149, 430, 501),]
```
The poorly fit samples are all from 2015 and 2016, warm season.  It is possible 
the fit for those years is affected by the prevalence of winter samples, with
the unbalanced sampling history biasing estimates.

### Marginal Means
```{r extract_lm_marginal_means}
din_emms_lm <- emmeans(din_lm, 'station', type = 'response')
din_emms_lm_jul <- emmeans(din_lm, 'station', type = 'response', 
                       at = list(month = 'Jul'))

plot(din_emms_lm) + coord_flip() + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.25))
```

### Compare to Observed Means
Unfortunately, this model does a fairly poor job regenerating the 
means from the original data, and standard errors for some estimates are 
very large (note the log-log plot).  This suggests this model is performing 
poorly.
```{r compare_lm_observed}
compare <- recent_results %>%
  select(station, station_name, contains('tn'), contains('din_N')) %>%
  full_join(din_emms_lm, by = 'station', suffix = c('.data', '.lm'), copy = TRUE)

ggplot(compare, aes(din_N_mn, response)) +
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0) + 
  geom_point(size = 3, color = 'blue') +
  geom_linerange(aes(xmin = din_N_mn - 2 * din_N_sd/sqrt(din_N_n), 
                     xmax = din_N_mn + 2 * din_N_sd/sqrt(din_N_n))) +
  geom_linerange(aes(ymin = lower.CL, ymax = upper.CL)) +
  xlab('Observed ') +
  ylab('Log Linear Model') +
  coord_equal() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10()
```

## Simplified Linear Models
We look at a linear models that do not include as many predictors, and show that 
they return marginal means that DO match the observed means fairly well.
```{r red_lm}
red_din_lm  <- lm(log(din_N) ~ station, data = recent_data)
din_emms_red_lm     <- emmeans(red_din_lm,     'station', type = 'response')
```


### Compare to Observed Means
```{r compare_red_lm_observed}
compare <- recent_results %>%
  select(station, station_name, contains('tn'), contains('din_N')) %>%
  full_join(din_emms_red_lm, by = 'station', suffix = c('.data', '.lm'), copy = TRUE)

ggplot(compare, aes(din_N_mn, response)) +
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0) + 
  geom_point(size = 3, color = 'blue') +
  geom_linerange(aes(xmin = din_N_mn - 2 * din_N_sd/sqrt(din_N_n), 
                     xmax = din_N_mn + 2 * din_N_sd/sqrt(din_N_n))) +
  geom_linerange(aes(ymin = lower.CL, ymax = upper.CL)) +
  xlab('Observed ') +
  ylab('Linear Model') +
  coord_equal() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10()
```
Standard errors are still fairly large, but the model at least provides
results closer to observed means.  Error bars tend to overlap the 1:1 line.
The differences here probably reflect the differences between geometric and 
arithmetic means.

All this suggests we are slicing these data too finely, and we should take a 
different approach. We have good data coverage from 2019, so we can restrict 
attention to 2019.

## GAM Model
We can use a GAM model to look more closely at seasonal patterns.
```{r gam_lodel}
din_gam <- gam(log(din_N) ~ station +  s(doy, bs = 'cc', k = 5) + 
                                         s(yearf, bs = 're'), 
               data = recent_data)
anova(din_gam)
```

```{r view_smoothers}
plot(din_gam)
```
The day of year smoother may be slightly over fit here, and we have not fully
explored interactions between seasonal effects and station.

```{r gam_diagnostics}
oldpar <- par(mfrow = c(2,2))
gam.check(din_gam)
par(oldpar)
```
Those diagnostics are not too bad, with the exception of large negative 
residuals again.

#### GAM Marginal Means
```{r gam_marginals}
din_emms_gam <- emmeans(din_gam, 'station', type = 'response', 
                        cov_reduce = median,
                        cov_keep = 'year',
                        at = list(doy = 200))
plot(din_emms_gam) + coord_flip() + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.25))
din_emms_gam <- as_tibble(din_emms_gam)
```

### Compare to Observed Mean
```{r compare_gam_observed}
compare <- recent_results %>%
  select(station, station_name, contains('tn'), contains('din_N')) %>%
  full_join(din_emms_gam, by = 'station', suffix = c('.data', '.lm'), copy = TRUE)

ggplot(compare, aes(din_N_mn, response)) +
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0) + 
  geom_point(size = 3, color = 'blue') +
  geom_linerange(aes(xmin = din_N_mn - 2 * din_N_sd/sqrt(din_N_n), 
                     xmax = din_N_mn + 2 * din_N_sd/sqrt(din_N_n))) +
  geom_linerange(aes(ymin = lower.CL, ymax = upper.CL)) +
  xlab('Observed ') +
  ylab('Log Linear Model') +
  coord_equal() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10()
```

This does better than the linear model, but only slightly

## Sample Sizes are Wildly Unequal
Sample sizes are wildly unequal....
```{r review_uneven_samples_month}
xtabs(~ year + month, data = recent_data , subset = ! is.na(din))
```

So, seasonal trnds outside of summer rest on just a handful of observations in
each of 2015 and 2016.

```{r  review_uneven_samples_sites}
xtabs(~ station + year, data = recent_data , subset = ! is.na(din))
```
And those observations come from just a handful of sites.

The problem here is the uneven sampling history.  We are trying to overinterpret
available data, leading to statistically unstable estimates.

# Restricted DIN Data (Year = 2019)
Our primary goal is to provide a map and accompanying chart of DIN levels.  For
that, we want to compare all sites on an even footing.  We now know that there
are important annual and seasonal processes at work, so the uneven sampling
history affects estimates of site conditions.

Data coverage in 2019 is fairly consistent.  Coverage is sparse, but
consistent across stations (but not months) in 2017 as well.

We restrict further attention to just 2019, as that data will not be affected by 
the uneven sampling history to the same extent.

```{r create_2019_data}
yr_2019_data <- recent_data %>%
  filter(year == 2019)  %>%
  select(station, station_name, dt, month, doy, din_N)
```

```{r hist_2019}
ggplot(yr_2019_data, aes(din_N)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  scale_x_continuous(trans = 'log')
```

```{r jitter_plot_2019}
ggplot(yr_2019_data, aes(din_N, station_name)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = month)) +
  scale_x_log10()
```

### Calculate Descriptive Statistics
```{r descriptives_2019}
results_2019 <- yr_2019_data %>%
  group_by(station) %>%
  summarize(across(din_N, c(mn = ~ mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE),
                                  sd = ~ sd(.x, na.rm = TRUE), 
                                  n = ~sum(! is.na(.x)),
                                  md = ~ median(.x, na.rm = TRUE),
                                  iqr = ~ IQR(.x, na.rm = TRUE),
                                  p90 = ~ quantile(.x, .9, na.rm = TRUE),
                                  gm = ~ exp(mean(log(.x), na.rm = TRUE))))) %>%
  mutate(station_name = names_df$Alt_Name[match(station,
                                                names_df$Station_ID)]) %>%
  mutate(station = fct_reorder(factor(station), din_N_md),
         station_name = fct_reorder(factor(station_name), din_N_md)) %>%
  relocate(station_name, .after = station)
```

### Linear Model
```{r lm_2019_full}
din_lm_2019_draft <- lm(log(din_N) ~ station *  month , data = yr_2019_data)
anova(din_lm_2019_draft)
```

```{r lm_2019}
din_lm_2019 <- lm(log(din_N) ~ station + month , data = yr_2019_data)
anova(din_lm_2019)
```

#### Marginal Means
```{r marginals_2019}
din_emms_lm_2019 <- emmeans(din_lm_2019, 'station', type = 'response')
plot(din_emms_lm_2019) + coord_flip()+ 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.25))
```

```{r marginals_2019_months}
din_emms_lm_2019_months <- emmeans(din_lm_2019, 'month', type = 'response')
plot(din_emms_lm_2019_months) + coord_flip()+ 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.25))
```

### Simplified Linear Model
```{r red_lm_2019}
din_lm_2019_red <- lm(log(din_N) ~ station  , data = yr_2019_data)
anova(din_lm_2019_red)
```

#### Marginal Means
```{r red_2018_marginals}
din_emms_lm_2019_red <- emmeans(din_lm_2019_red, 'station', type = 'response')
plot(din_emms_lm_2019_red) + coord_flip() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.25))
```
Qualitatively nearly indistinguishable, although stnadard errors are likely 
larger.

###  Robust Linear Model
Thee `rlm()` function from `MASS` implements robust model fitting using M
estimators.  These are estimators that do not use least squares as a criterion
for model fit.  Instead, they use other symmetric functions to quantify the
relative importance of the deviation of each observation from model predictions.
To achieve "robust" qualities, these functions drop off in value at higher
deviations from model predictions, making extreme points count less, or not at 
all, when fitting the model.

Robust linear models, as implemented via `rlm()` from the `MASS`
package do not accept models not of full rank, which is proven a bit of
a problem for these uneven data sets. We can not fit a station + month model.
```{r robust_lm_err_1, error = TRUE}
din_rlm_2019_FAILS <- rlm(log(din_N) ~ station + month, 
                     na.action = na.omit,
                     data = yr_2019_data)
```

```{r robust_lm}
din_rlm_2019 <- rlm(log(din_N) ~ station, 
                     na.action = na.omit,
                     data = yr_2019_data)
```


#### Marginal Means
```{r robust_lm_marginals}
din_emms_lm_2019 <- as_tibble(emmeans(din_lm_2019, 
                                      'station', type = 'response'))
din_emms_rlm_2019 <- as_tibble(emmeans(din_rlm_2019, 
                                      'station', type = 'response'))
```

## GAM model
We can use a GAM model to look at seasonal patterns within this one year, but
this also may be overfitting available data.  We don't fit a cyclic smoother
because our data covers only a small portion of the year.
```{r gam_2019}
din_gam_2019 <- gam(log(din_N) ~ station +  s(doy, bs = 'cs', k = 6), 
               data = yr_2019_data)
anova(din_gam_2019)
```

```{r view_gam_2019}
plot(din_gam_2019)
```
The day of year smoother may be slightly over fit here.

```{r gam_2019_diagnostics}
oldpar <- par(mfrow = c(2,2))
gam.check(din_gam)
par(oldpar)
```
Those diagnostics are not too bad, with the exception of large negative 
residuals again.

#### GAM Marginal Means
```{r gam_2019_marginals}
din_emms_gam_2019 <- emmeans(din_gam_2019, 'station', type = 'response')
plot(din_emms_gam_2019) + coord_flip() + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.25))
din_emms_gam_2019 <- as_tibble(din_emms_gam_2019)
```


### Compare Model Results -- Does Model Selection Matter?
#### Compare Models to Observed Means
##### Log Linear Model
```{r compare_2019_lm}
compare <- results_2019 %>%
  select(station, station_name, contains('tn'), contains('din_N')) %>%
  full_join(din_emms_lm_2019, by = 'station', suffix = c('.data', '.lm'), 
            copy = TRUE)

ggplot(compare, aes(din_N_mn, response)) +
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0) + 
  geom_point(size = 3, color = 'blue') +
  geom_linerange(aes(xmin = din_N_mn - 2 * din_N_sd/sqrt(din_N_n), 
                     xmax = din_N_mn + 2 * din_N_sd/sqrt(din_N_n))) +
  geom_linerange(aes(ymin = lower.CL, ymax = upper.CL)) +
  xlab('Observed ') +
  ylab('Robust Linear Model') +
  coord_equal() +
  scale_x_log10()+
  scale_y_log10()
```
The log linear model generally fits means slightly lower than observed. This 
is what is expected as we are effectively fitting geometric means instead of
arithmetic means.

##### Robust Log Linear Model
```{r compare_2019_rlm}
compare <- results_2019 %>%
  select(station, station_name, contains('tn'), contains('din_N')) %>%
  full_join(din_emms_rlm_2019, by = 'station', suffix = c('.data', '.lm'), 
            copy = TRUE)

ggplot(compare, aes(din_N_mn, response)) +
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0) + 
  geom_point(size = 3, color = 'blue') +
  geom_linerange(aes(xmin = din_N_mn - 2 * din_N_sd/sqrt(din_N_n), 
                     xmax = din_N_mn + 2 * din_N_sd/sqrt(din_N_n))) +
  geom_linerange(aes(ymin = asymp.LCL, ymax = asymp.UCL)) +
  xlab('Observed ') +
  ylab('Robust Linear Model') +
  coord_equal() +
  scale_x_log10()+
  scale_y_log10()
```
Results of the robust model are very similar.

##### GAM Model
```{r compare_2019_gam}
compare <- results_2019 %>%
  select(station, station_name, contains('tn'), contains('din_N')) %>%
  full_join(din_emms_gam_2019, by = 'station', suffix = c('.data', '.lm'), 
            copy = TRUE)

ggplot(compare, aes(din_N_mn, response)) +
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0) + 
  geom_point(size = 3, color = 'blue') +
  geom_linerange(aes(xmin = din_N_mn - 2 * din_N_sd/sqrt(din_N_n), 
                     xmax = din_N_mn + 2 * din_N_sd/sqrt(din_N_n))) +
  geom_linerange(aes(ymin = lower.CL, ymax = upper.CL)) +
  xlab('Observed ') +
  ylab('GAM Model') +
  coord_equal() +
  scale_x_log10()+
  scale_y_log10()
```

The GAM model provides adjusted estimates that generally lie close to the 
observed means.  These estimates are effectively adjusted for different sampling 
histories.  Note that error bars are higher than for the straight means.

#### Compare Log Linear and Robust Log Linear Models
We can show that more clearly by plotting the predictions of the two models 
against one another.
```{r compare_2019_models}
compare <- as_tibble(din_emms_lm_2019) %>%
  full_join(din_emms_rlm_2019, by = 'station', suffix = c('.lm', '.rlm'))
ggplot(compare, aes(response.lm, response.rlm)) +
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0) + 
  geom_point(size = 3, color = 'blue') +
  geom_linerange(aes(xmin = lower.CL, xmax = upper.CL)) +
  geom_linerange(aes(ymin = asymp.LCL, ymax = asymp.UCL)) +
  xlab('Linear Model') +
  ylab('Robust Linear Model') +
  coord_equal() +
  scale_x_log10()+
  scale_y_log10()
```
So, results are qualitatively similar. There is no strong reason to prefer the 
robust estimates to the linear model estimates where qualitative results are 
similar and model diagnostics are fairly good.

### DIN  Recent Condition Conclusions
Restricting attention to 2019 makes sense. There appears to be little advantage
to robust models.  Even so, there are several approaches possible:  
1.  Just use observed means / medians.  
2.  Use fitted means from the simplest linear models.  This effectively fits
    geometric means, not arithmetic means, and pools error estimates.   
3.  Use Marginal Means from the GAM model - -these are effectively adjusted for
    different  sampling histories.

# Trend Analysis
Few stations have data from more than a few years.  DIN data has been collected 
over the past couple of years, at several stations in the mid 200s, and at a
handful of stations pretty much every year since 2001.  Generally the rule we 
have used to examine trends is to ficus on sites with relatively complete 
records, say at least two of the last five years and at least
ten years total.  

## Identify Trend Stations
```{r which_stations}
trend_sites <- strict_data %>%
  group_by(station, year) %>%
  summarize(was_sampled =  ! all(is.na(din_N)),
            .groups = 'drop_last') %>%
  summarize(last_5 = sum(was_sampled & year > 2014),
            total = sum(was_sampled),
            .groups = 'drop') %>%
  filter(total >= 10, last_5 >= 2) %>%
  pull(station)
trend_sites
```
## Generate Trend Data
```{r make_trend_data}
trend_data <- strict_data %>%
  filter(station %in% trend_sites) %>%
   mutate(station_name = names_df$Alt_Name[match(station,
                                                names_df$Station_ID)]) %>%
   mutate(station = factor(station),
          station_name = factor(station_name)) %>%
   mutate(station = fct_reorder(station, din_N, na.rm = TRUE),
         station_name = fct_reorder(station_name, din_N, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
   relocate(station_name, .after = station) %>%
   select(-tn_depth, -tn, -organic_N)
```

## Data Prevalence
```{r trend_data_months}
xtabs(~ month + station, data = trend_data )%>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  mutate(month = factor(month, levels = month.abb)) %>%
  filter(n>0) %>%

  ggplot(aes(station, month, fill = sqrt(n))) +
  geom_tile() +
  theme_cbep(base_size = 12) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = .25))
```
So we have few winter samples from four of these sites, suggesting we may want 
to look at a more limited subset of the data to avoid introducing bias into
our models.  The core data is from April to October.  We could focus on sites 
with more complete records, or focus on months with more sites.

```{r trend_data_years}
xtabs(~ year + station, data = trend_data) %>%
  as_tibble() %>% 
  filter(n>0) %>%

  ggplot(aes(station, year, fill = sqrt(n))) +
  geom_tile() +
  theme_cbep(base_size = 12) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = .25))
```
The same station have more complete records, suggesting we may also want to 
the define five core trend stations where data is more complete.

```{r trend_data_times}
xtabs(~ year + month, data = trend_data) %>%
  as_tibble() %>% 
  mutate(month = factor(month, levels = month.abb))  %>%
  filter(n>0) %>%

  ggplot(aes(month, year, fill = sqrt(n))) +
  geom_tile() +
  theme_cbep(base_size = 12) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = .25))
```

Most winter samples are older, but we have a few winter samples right up until
the last few years. The lack of recent winter data means we need to be cautious 
about interpreting long-term trends, because we know from prior analyses that 
din_N values tend to be lower in the summer months.

We are mostly interested in month (or more generally, time of year) as a
covariate. Although seasonal variation is complex, probably 
differing year to year and site to site, this is a place where we may be able to
fit a hierarchical model to assist with bridging some data gaps.

# Core Site Trend Data
```{r find_core_sites}
core_sites <- strict_data %>%
  group_by(station, year) %>%
  summarize(was_sampled =  ! all(is.na(din_N)),
            .groups = 'drop_last') %>%
  summarize( total = sum(was_sampled),
            .groups = 'drop') %>%
  filter(total >= 15) %>%
  pull(station)
core_sites
```

```{r make_core_sites_data}
core_sites_data <- trend_data %>%
  filter(station %in% core_sites)
```

## Jitter Plot By Year
```{r core_sites_jitter_plot_by_yr, fig.height = 7, fig.width = 3}
ggplot(core_sites_data, aes(year, din_N,)) +
  geom_jitter(aes( color = station_name), alpha = 0.5) + 
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = 'line', lwd = 1) +
  scale_y_continuous(trans = 'log1p', breaks = c(0,5,10,30)) +
  facet_wrap(~station_name, nrow = 5) +
  scale_color_manual(values = cbep_colors()) +
  theme_cbep(base_size = 12) +
  theme(legend.position = 'None')
```

We note a small number of nominal zero values in 2003 and 2004.  We note that
neither log-transforms nor  transformed data conform well to assumptions of
normality, but the log plus one transform works well.

We note no obvious linear pattern to the annual means, but there is a possible 
drop in annual averages in recent years. Unfortunately, that drop corresponds
to years whn winter samples are no longer being collected.


## Real Dates and Times
First, we create a summary dataframe
```{r create_summary}
core_site_summary  <-   core_sites_data %>%
  select(station_name, year, din_N) %>%
  group_by(station_name, year) %>%
  summarize(ann_mn_din_N = mean(din_N, na.rm = TRUE),
            .groups = 'drop_last') %>%
  filter(! is.na(ann_mn_din_N)) %>%
  mutate(dt = as.Date (paste0('06-15-', year), format = '%m-%d-%Y'))
```


```{r core_sites_plot_by_date, fig.height = 7, fig.width = 3}
ggplot(core_sites_data) +
  geom_point(aes(dt, din_N, color = station_name), alpha = 0.5) + 
  geom_line(data = core_site_summary, 
            mapping = aes(x = dt, y = ann_mn_din_N), 
            lwd = 1,
            color = cbep_colors()[3]) +
  scale_y_continuous(trans = 'log1p') +
  facet_wrap(~station_name, nrow = 5) +
  scale_color_manual(values = cbep_colors()) +
  theme_cbep(base_size = 12) +
  theme(legend.position = 'None') +
  xlab('') +
  ylab('DIN (mg/l as N)')
```

# Core Months Trend Data
```{r make_core_months_data}
core_months_data <- trend_data %>%
  filter(month %in% month.abb[5:10])
```


## Jitter Plot By Year
```{r core_months_jitter_plot_by_yr, fig.height = 7, fig.width = 5}
ggplot(core_months_data, aes(year, din_N,)) +
  geom_jitter(aes(color = station_name)) + 
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = 'line', lwd = 1) +
  scale_y_continuous(trans = 'log1p') +
  facet_wrap(~station_name, nrow = 4) +
  scale_color_viridis_d(option = 'viridis') +
  theme_cbep(base_size = 12) +
  theme(legend.position = 'None',
        panel.spacing.x = unit(2.5, "lines"))
```

##Actual Dates
```{r make_core_months_summary}
core_months_summary  <-   core_months_data %>%
  select(station_name, year, din_N) %>%
  group_by(station_name, year) %>%
  summarize(ann_mn_din_N = mean(din_N, na.rm = TRUE),
            .groups = 'drop_last') %>%
  filter(! is.na(ann_mn_din_N)) %>%
  mutate(dt = as.Date (paste0('06-15-', year), format = '%m-%d-%Y'))
```


```{r core_months_jitter_plot_by_date, fig.height = 7, fig.width = 5}
ggplot(core_months_data) +
  geom_point(aes(dt, din_N, color = station_name), alpha = 0.5) + 
  geom_line(data = core_months_summary, 
            mapping = aes(x = dt, y = ann_mn_din_N), 
            lwd = 1,
            color = cbep_colors()[3]) +
  scale_y_continuous(trans = 'log1p') +
  facet_wrap(~station_name, nrow = 4) +
  scale_color_viridis_d(option = 'viridis') +
  theme_cbep(base_size = 12) +
  theme(legend.position = 'None',
        panel.spacing.x = unit(2.5, "lines")) +
  xlab('') +
  ylab('DIN (mg/l as N)')
```

# Models
## Initial Linear Model
Note that in this setting, there is no reason to believe all stations show the 
same trend, so a model that does not fit an interaction term (station x year)
is of limited value.  The exception may be use of hierarchical model that treats
sites as random factors.
```{r trend_lm_1}
trnd_lm_1 <- lm(log1p(din_N) ~ (year + station + month)^2 , 
                data = core_months_data)
anova(trnd_lm_1)
```

```{r trend_lm_step}
trnd_lm_2 <- step(trnd_lm_1)
```

```{r anova_trend_lm_2}
anova(trnd_lm_2)
```

```{r summary_trend_lm_2}
summary(trnd_lm_2)
```

So the obvious linear model analysis suggests there is a weak positive linear
trend, and there are no differences in trend among stations.  But that misses 
what may be a recent decline.

```{r trend_lm_2_diagnostics}
oldpar <- par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(trnd_lm_2)
par(oldpar)
```
Other than the skewness of the residuals, model diagnostics
are pretty good, suggesting these conclusions will be robust to most other
reasonable model specifications.

## Check for Non-linear Patterns
We start by fitting a polynomial 
```{r trend_polynomial}
trnd_lm_3 <- lm(log1p(din_N) ~ poly(year,2) + poly(year,2):station + 
                                month + month:year, data = core_months_data)
anova(trnd_lm_3)
```

So, there is evidence for non-linear changes over time. The problem is, we 
expect year to year changes due to things like weather, so it is hard to 
evaluate whether any of this matters.  To get a handle on that, we turn to a GAM 
model, .

```{r trend_gam_1}
trnd_gam_1 <- gam(din_N ~ station + month +
                    s(year, by = station, k = 5),
                  data = core_months_data)
anova(trnd_gam_1)
```
```{r trend_gam_2}
trnd_gam_2 <- gam(din_N ~ station + month +
                    s(year, k = 5),
                  data = core_months_data)
anova(trnd_gam_1, trnd_gam_2)
AIC(trnd_gam_1, trnd_gam_2)
```

SO there's a large increase in deviance going to the simpler model (on the order 
of 5%) and AIC goes up substantially.  We need the more complex model.

```{r view_gam_smoothers}
plot(trnd_gam_1, se = FALSE, trans = log1p)
```

These effects are relatively large, compared to the means, but the patterns are
different from site to site.  In other words, there is little here to
interpret that would add insight to readers.  The conclusion is, there are
year to year differences, that differ site to site, and thus no real trends.

It is possible a formal time series analysis might uncover autocorrelation
structure, but that is well beyond our current needs.
